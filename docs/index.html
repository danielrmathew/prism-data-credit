            <p>Credit scores are pivotal in today’s financial landscape, influencing everything from rental eligibility 
                to access to health insurance, yet the formula for calculating creditworthiness has long been shrouded
                in mystery and often overlooks important nuances. Typically, the credit score is determined based on 
                five factors: payment history, the amount owed, new credit, credit history, and credit mix. This 
                structure can place individuals with limited credit history— especially young adults who are just 
                starting out building their credits —at a compounded disadvantage, restricting their access to loans,
                credit cards, employment opportunities, and insurance. This report aims to address this unfairness 
                by creating a more comprehensive measure of creditworthiness by incorporating detailed account 
                transaction analysis into the equation. To achieve this, we will build a model that generates 
                probability-based scores reflecting the likelihood of delinquency, leveraging detailed bank transaction
                data to provide a fairer and more transparent assessment of financial responsibility.</p>

            We adopted a systematic and iterative approach to model development, emphasizing continuous refinement and enhancement
            of features alongside model selection and performance evaluation. We began with logistic regression to establish a 
            baseline and identify key features. As the process evolved, we integrated more advanced algorithms like 
            HistGradientBoosting (HistGB), CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost, chosen for their ability to handle complex data patterns.
            Throughout the iterations, we focused on refining and enhancing feature generation, selecting the most relevant ones to 
            improve the model’s performance. This iterative process allows us to optimize the model’s predictive power.

            <h2>Methods</h2>
            
            <h3>Data Collection and Preparation</h3>
            <p>We utilized a dataset from Prism Data, containing consumer financial transactions, account balances, and related attributes. As the dataset was preprocessed, minimal cleaning was needed. Our focus was on ensuring consistency, handling missing values, standardizing categorical variables, and optimizing time-series data for modeling.</p>
            
            <h3>Feature Generation</h3>
            <p>We engineered features to capture financial behavior through transaction history, balance trends, 
                spending patterns, and risk indicators. Our feature generation process included:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Window Analysis:</strong> Transactions were analyzed across multiple time windows—14 
                    days, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year—to capture short- and long-term trends.</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregated Statistics:</strong> Summary statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, median, standard 
                    deviation, sum, count, percent of transactions) are calculated on categorical and balance trends.
                <li><strong>Risk Indicators:</strong> High-risk behaviors were identified through flagged transactions, 
                    such as gambling, using threshold-based indicators.</li>
                <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Non-categorical features were standardized to ensure consistent 
                    scaling.</li>
                <li><strong>Resampling:</strong> SMOTE and undersampling techniques were used to rebalance the training 
                    data.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Feature Selection</h3>
            <p>To refine model input, we performed feature selection using the following techniques:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Correlation Analysis:</strong> Selected top features most correlated with delinquency using Lasso (L1) Regularization.</li>
                <li><strong>Mutual Information:</strong> Identified features with the highest mutual information score for predictive power.</li>
                <li><strong>Embedded Method:</strong> Utilized Random Forest to rank and select the most relevant features.</li>
            </ul>

                    <h3>Categorical Boosting (CatBoost)</h3>
                    <p>CatBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm that efficiently handles categorical
                         data by using ordered boosting and target statistics to prevent overfitting. 
                         It builds symmetric decision trees, ensuring balanced splits that improve model 
                         stability and generalization. CatBoost also incorporates regularization techniques 
                         and optimizations for faster computation.</p>

            <h3>Histogram-based Gradient Boosting (HistGB)</h3>
            <p>HistGB is a variation of gradient boosting that uses histogram-based binning to speed up training and improve memory efficiency. It is particularly well-suited for large datasets and high-dimensional features.</p>
        
            <h3>Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)</h3>
            <p>LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that builds decision trees using a leaf-wise approach, allowing for faster training and reduced memory usage compared to traditional boosting methods.</p>
        
            <h3>Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)</h3>
            <p>XGBoost is a widely used gradient boosting algorithm known for its regularization techniques and parallel processing capabilities, making it effective for structured data tasks.</p>
        
            <h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
            <p>Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective linear model for binary classification. It models the probability of an event occurring based on input features and serves as our baseline model for comparison.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Our research highlights that incorporating detailed bank transaction data into credit scoring models results
                 in performance that is comparable to traditional models, all without the necessity of credit history. 
                 This innovative approach allows for a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of an individual’s 
                 creditworthiness, providing a more holistic view of their financial behavior. By utilizing transactional 
                 data, we aim to improve the accuracy of credit scoring, offering a more transparent and equitable evaluation 
                 process. This model addresses existing biases and limitations in traditional credit scoring, especially for 
                 individuals with limited or no credit history, such as young adults or those from underrepresented groups. 
                 Ultimately, this approach seeks to enhance fairness and inclusivity within the financial system, increasing 
                 access to credit opportunities for those who have historically been overlooked or excluded from traditional 
                 lending practices.</p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expand Dataset:</strong> Train and test on a full-size dataset to evaluate model performance at scale.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Refinement:</strong> Continuously tune and test additional models, such as deep learning techniques, 
                    to improve predictive accuracy. Focus on hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance, experimenting with 
                    different configurations of parameters like learning rates, regularization factors, and network architectures for 
                    deep learning models.</li>
