# Building Better Credit Scores: Machine Learning and NLP for Optimized Risk Assessment

This project aims to enhance credit scoring by using machine learning and NLP to analyze transaction data, creating a fairer, more comprehensive measure of creditworthiness.

## Description

Credit scores are pivotal in today’s financial landscape, influencing everything from rental eligibility to access to health insurance, yet the formula for calculating creditworthiness has long been shrouded in mystery and often overlooks important nuances. Typically, the credit score is determined based on five factors: payment history, the amount owed, new credit, credit history, and credit mix. This structure can place individuals with limited credit history— especially young adults who are just starting out building their credits —at a compounded disadvantage, restricting their access to loans, credit cards, employment opportunities, and insurance. This report aims to address this unfairness by creating a more comprehensive measure of creditworthiness by incorporating detailed account transaction analysis into the equation. To achieve this, we will build a transaction categorization model using NLP techniques, enabling a deeper and fairer evaluation of financial behavior.


## Getting Started

### Executing program

* Run all cells to ensure the code executes sequentially and that all dependencies and variables are initialized properly.
* This will verify that outputs display as expected throughout the notebook.
* Master.ipynb contains the culmination of our finalized work.
* For individual contributions, refer to the notebooks labeled with our respective names.
